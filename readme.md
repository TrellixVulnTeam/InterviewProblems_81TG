# Interview Problems

These are a small collection of interview problems from sites like 
https://www.hackerrank.com and https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/
that I have collected, for my own practice, and to use as  interview
questions in my current job.

## Format

### Problem Statement
In the `/src/main/resources` directory you'll find the problem descriptions

### Sample Template
In the `/src/main/java` `/src/main/javascript` and `/src/main/scala` you'll find a sample file to get started on the  problems.  These files were in the format used by hackerank.com

### Solution 
My solution for Problem 003 is in `/src/main/scala/solutions/_003` directory.  You get the idea

#### Tests
When possible I've added unit tests in `/src/main/tests`
