# Interview Problems

These are a small collection of interview problems from sites like 
https://www.hackerrank.com and https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/
that I have collected, for my own practice, and to use as  interview
questions in my current job.

## Project Structure: 

### Problem Statements
In the `/src/main/resources/problems` directory you'll find the problem descriptions

### Sample Templates
In the `/src/main/java/templates` `/src/main/javascript/templates` and `/src/main/scala/templates`
you'll find a sample file to get started on the problems (at  least in one of  these languages)

These files were in the format used by hackerank.com

### Solutions 
My solutions for problems are in the `/src/main/{Language}/solutions/` directory.

### Tests
When I have time I'll added unit tests in `/src/main/tests`
