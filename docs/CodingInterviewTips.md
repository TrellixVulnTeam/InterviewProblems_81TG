## What Interviewers Look for:

### Communication:
Make sure you understand the question and read it back to your interviewer. Be sure to ask any clarifying questions. An
interview is a two-way conversation; feel free to be the one to ask questions, too.

Are you asking for requirements and clarity when necessary, or are you just diving into the code? Your initial tech
screen should be a conversation, so donâ€™t forget to ask questions.

### Problem Solving:
Don't rush. Take some time to consider your approach. For example, on a tree question, you'll need to choose between an
iterative or a recursive approach. It's OK to first use a working, unoptimized solution that you can improve on later.
Talk through your thinking and processes out loud. This can feel unnatural; be sure to practice it before the interview.

You'll be evaluated on how you comprehend and explain complex ideas. Are you providing the reasoning behind a particular
solution? Developing and comparing multiple solutions? Using appropriate data structures? Speaking about space and time
complexity? Optimizing your solution?

### Coding:
Can you convert solutions to executable code? Is the code organized and does it capture the right logical structure?


### Verification:
Test your code by running through your problem with a few test and edge cases. Again, talk through your logic out loud
when you walk through your test cases.

Are you considering a reasonable number of test cases or coming up with a good argument for why your code is correct?
If your solution has bugs, are you able to walk through your own logic to find them and explain what the code is doing?

### Performance/Optimization:
Think of how your solution could be better, and try to improve it. When you've finished, your interviewer will ask you
to analyze the complexity of the code in Big O notation. Walk through your code line by line and assign a complexity to
each line.
